# Functional Maze

An attempt to build a tiny console game in a purely functional fashion.

Lots of desgin choices are overkill and some other are not implemented yet !

## Game rules

You (`\o/`) have to go from the start (op left) to the exit (`?`) by moving around using `ZQSD` or `QASD` while avoiding the traps (`x`) !

Here is the map with a side size of 10 and 20 traps:

```
  ______________________________ 
 \o/    x  x     x  x          |
|       x           x  x       |
|    x                    x    |
|    x  x              x  x    |
|             x     x          |
|       x                 x    |
|                              |
| x     x     x     x          |
|    x        x  x             |
|                x     x     ?

Sorry about how the console prints... gonna fix it later !
